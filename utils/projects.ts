        This is a project I made for my bachelor thesis. 
        The goal was to make a self-driving rc car that runs on a Raspberry Pi.
        It uses a single camera to observe the road and sends the captured images trough a neural network to determine the steering angle.

        The company Mother asked us to develop a section inside their already existing app to scan plants.
        The app had to be able to identify the type of plant and the state of health, only by taking a picture of it.
        The frontend of the app was made with Vue Native and the backend was made with Google Firebase. 
        We created a Neural Network with Tensorflow to predict the type of plant in the picture.

        BackPi was the first project I ever made. It's a backpak that uses an NFC-scanner to know what's inside. It was built with a Raspberry Pi and had a website made with Flask.
        You could setup an agenda and assign items to certain events so it would notify you whenever you forget something.

            This was a group project. We had to create an interactive playground based on a Microsoft Kinect and a projector            
            The interactive playground was a project for the sports department of Howest. They wanted us to create a similar product as the interactive playground of LÃ¼.
